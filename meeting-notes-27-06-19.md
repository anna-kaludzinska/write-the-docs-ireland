### Social Meetup Notes and Agenda

#### June 27th, 2019


**Attendees:** Vlada, Stephen, Ania, Bridget, Alan, Richard


**Agenda:**
* Meet and greet new faces!
* Let’s discuss organizing the next meetup, decide on the nature (presentation/talks meetup in the works, do we need to schedule another social meetup meanwhile?) Are we happy with the current format?


**Meeting Minutes:**

The following are some of the topics we briefly discussed and want to learn more about:
* Discussions on Style Guides (use of gerund vs imperative mood in procedure/task based topics)
* Interest in information security and accessibility (ISO standards)
* Privacy policies around social networks
* Grammar structure/style guides
* For the next social meetup, specify that it’s the Westmoreland Starbucks, just beside the Luas stop
* EU directive on documentation
* Accessibility mini-presentation from Alan
* Richard will share his experience on training devs to write better
* Bridget will give a short presentation on information mapping, structure (eu directives)
* Vlada will talk about minimalism principles that can be used in peer reviews
* Alan to talk about payment service directive (PSD2): multi-factor authentication
* Others will prepare short presentations on other topics (Ania to talk about style guides - TBD)
* Include twitter account for [useless assist](https://twitter.com/uselessassist) (funny examples of poor documentation)
* 25th July next meetup


**Actions:**
* Edited the WTD meetup page in progress (the location has been changed to Dublin)
* Schedule the next meetup (in the process of confirming venue availability, need to confirm presentations)
* Establish a rotation for discussion moderators for every meetup (Ania, thank you for volunteering)
* Set an agenda for the next meetup
* Make the notes available to the group
* Join the WTD #ireland slack
